# Spirit Island Tracker

Welcome to Spirit Island Tracker. This is a webapp created to replace the invader board for Spirit Island, to reduce the amount of setup needed when playing the board game. Currently under development. 

# Features

### Turn Tracking
Turns are automatically tracked and advanced with a single button press. The indicator pane updates depending on what phase is coming next, including dynamically displayed invader actions and adversary-specific actions. 

### Fear Tracking
No more being confused between earned fear tokens and fear pool tokens. Fears are now generated with a single button! Amount of fear tokens earned and fear cards earned are dynamically displayed on the left pane, and resolved when the turn tracker reaches the fear card phase. 

### Card Drawing
Shuffled fear decks or event decks for a setup just to lose to England 6 after 10 minutes? Not to worry! With Spirit Island Tracker, fear cards and event cards are automatically drawn when the corresponding phases have been reached. Also includes an option to redraw if you want to cheat a little bit (under development). 

### Special Actions (*Under Development*)
Actions that influence the setup of the invader board (e.g. England 6, Fractured Days) will be supported via a dedicated menu accessed via a single click.
